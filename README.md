# Vortex Game Extension for MiABSFD Support

Adds Vortex support for MiABSFD. Supports the following mods: basic pak mods, UE4SS Lua mods, and UE4SS Blueprint mods.

## Features

- **Supports pak mods, UE4SS Lua mods, and UE4SS Blueprint mods.**
- **Mod installation convenience.** Simply drag and drop / _Install From File..._ the zip file, and as long as it is any of the mods supported above and in the right format, it'll get handled automatically.
- **Leaves the game directory untouched.** You can Enable / Disable mods as you will, etc. and the base game files shouldn't get affected.
